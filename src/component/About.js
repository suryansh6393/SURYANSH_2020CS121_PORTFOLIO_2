            <p>Myself Suryansh Pandey,I have always enjoyed coming up with innovative solutions to challenges. I enjoyed experimenting with broken objects during my childhood, figuring out how they worked and repairing them. I was clear about my career goals when I graduated from high school.

My degree is about to complete at ABES Institute Of Technology, where I learned to apply critical thinking and problem-solving techniques to today's complicated issues. If you are interested in giving me a position in your organization, please connect me on LinkedIn or send me an email at suryansh6393@gmail.com.</p>
